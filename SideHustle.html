                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>
                    A side hustle refers to a way of making extra money outside of a primary job or career. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It can be anything from selling handmade goods or digital products online, freelancing, pet-sitting, or driving for ride-sharing services. The idea is to leverage skills, talents, and resources to create a profitable business or provide a service to others. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Side hustles can provide an additional income stream to help pay bills or pursue personal goals. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It can also be a way to explore new interests, test out a business idea, or develop skills that can lead to a new career opportunity. The possibilities for side hustles are endless, and they can be a great way to achieve financial independence and flexibility in one's career.
